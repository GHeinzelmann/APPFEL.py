# APPFEL.py

The Automated Protein-Protein Free Energy tooL (APPFEL.py) is a python tool designed to calculate the affinity of a receptor-ligand complex made of two polypeptide chains. It takes advantage of the collective variables module from the simulation software NAMD, which can apply a sophisticated set of harmonic restraints to multiple groups of atoms. APPFEL can perform absolute binding free energy (ABFE) calculations starting only from the pdb structure of the complex, with all the needed steps to build and simulate the systems being performed in a fully automated way.
